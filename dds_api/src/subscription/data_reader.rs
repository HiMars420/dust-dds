    /// • If DESTINATION_ORDER is BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP, samples belonging to the same instances will appear in

    /// the maximum length (max_len), and whether the collection container owns the memory of the elements within (owns). PSM
    /// mappings that do not provide these facilities may need to change the signature of the read operation slightly to compensate for
    /// it.
    /// The initial (input) values of the len, max_len, and owns properties for the data_values and sample_infos collections govern the
    /// behavior of the read operation as specified by the following rules:
    /// values of len, max_len, and owns for the two collections must be identical. Otherwise read will and return
    /// PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.
    /// 2. On successful output, the values of len, max_len, and owns will be the same for both collections.
    /// 3. If the input max_len= =0, then the data_values and sample_infos collections will be filled with elements that are
    /// ‘loaned’ by the DataReader. On output, owns will be FALSE, len will be set to the number of values returned, and
    /// max_len will be set to a value verifying max_len >= len. The use of this variant allows for zero-copy22 access to the
    /// data and the application will need to “return the loan” to the DataWriter using the return_loan operation (see
    /// 2.2.2.5.3.20).
    /// 4. If the input max_len>0 and the input owns= =FALSE, then the read operation will fail and return
    /// PRECONDITION_NOT_MET. This avoids the potential hard-to-detect memory leaks caused by an application
    /// forgetting to “return the loan.”
    /// 5. If input max_len>0 and the input owns= =TRUE, then the read operation will copy the Data values and SampleInfo
    /// values into the elements already inside the collections. On output, owns will be TRUE, len will be set to the
    /// number of values copied, and max_len will remain unchanged. The use of this variant forces a copy but the
    /// application can control where the copy is placed and the application will not need to “return the loan.” The number
    /// of samples copied depends on the relative values of max_len and max_samples:
    /// • If max_samples = LENGTH_UNLIMITED, then at most max_len values will be copied. The use of this variant lets
    /// the application limit the number of samples returned to what the sequence can accommodate.
    /// • If max_samples <= max_len, then at most max_samples values will be copied. The use of this variant lets the
    /// application limit the number of samples returned to fewer that what the sequence can accommodate.
    /// • If max_samples > max_len, then the read operation will fail and return PRECONDITION_NOT_MET. This
    /// avoids the potential confusion where the application expects to be able to access up to max_samples, but that
    /// number can never be returned, even if they are available in the DataReader, because the output sequence cannot
    /// accommodate them.
    /// As described above, upon return the data_values and sample_infos collections may contain elements “loaned” from the
    /// DataReader. If this is the case, the application will need to use the return_loan operation (see 2.2.2.5.3.20) to return the
    /// “loan” once it is no longer using the Data in the collection. Upon return from return_loan, the collection will have max_len=0
    /// and owns=FALSE.
    /// The application can determine whether it is necessary to “return the loan” or not based on how the state of the collections when
    /// the read operation was called, or by accessing the ‘owns’ property. However, in many cases it may be simpler to always call
    /// return_loan, as this operation is harmless (i.e., leaves all elements unchanged) if the collection does not have a loan.
    /// To avoid potential memory leaks, the implementation of the Data and SampleInfo collections should disallow changing the
    /// length of a collection for which owns= =FALSE. Furthermore, deleting a collection for which owns= =FALSE should be
    /// considered an error.
    /// On output, the collection of Data values and the collection of SampleInfo structures are of the same length and are in a one-toone
