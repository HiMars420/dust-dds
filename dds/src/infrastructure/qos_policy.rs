/// It provides the basic mechanism for an application to specify quality of service parameters. It has an attribute name that is used
/// to identify uniquely each QoS policy. All concrete QosPolicy classes derive from this root and include a value whose type
/// depends on the concrete QoS policy.
/// The type of a QosPolicy value may be atomic, such as an integer or float, or compound (a structure). Compound types are used
/// whenever multiple parameters must be set coherently to define a consistent value for a QosPolicy.
/// Each Entity can be configured with a list of QosPolicy. However, any Entity cannot support any QosPolicy. For instance, a
/// DomainParticipant supports different QosPolicy than a Topic or a Publisher.
/// QosPolicy can be set when the Entity is created, or modified with the set_qos method. Each QosPolicy in the list is treated
/// independently from the others. This approach has the advantage of being very extensible. However, there may be cases where
/// several policies are in conflict. Consistency checking is performed each time the policies are modified via the set_qos
/// operation.
/// When a policy is changed after being set to a given value, it is not required that the new value be applied instantaneously; the
/// Service is allowed to apply it after a transition phase. In addition, some QosPolicy have “immutable” semantics meaning that
/// they can only be specified either at Entity creation time or else prior to calling the enable operation on the Entity.
/// Sub clause 2.2.3, Supported QoS provides the list of all QosPolicy, their meaning, characteristics and possible values, as well

/// maintain some data for its own purposes (e.g., flow control) and yet not make it available to late-joining readers if the

/// that VOLATILE < TRANSIENT_LOCAL < TRANSIENT < PERSISTENT.
/// For the purpose of implementing the DURABILITY QoS kind TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT, the service behaves “as if” for
/// each Topic that has TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT DURABILITY kind there was a corresponding “built-in” DataReader and
/// DataWriter configured to have the same DURABILITY kind. In other words, it is “as if” somewhere in the system (possibly
/// on a remote node) there was a “built-in durability DataReader” that subscribed to that Topic and a “built-in durability
/// DataWriter” that published that Topic as needed for the new subscribers that join the system.
/// For each Topic, the built-in fictitious “persistence service” DataReader and DataWriter has its QoS configured from the Topic
/// QoS of the corresponding Topic. In other words, it is “as-if” the service first did find_topic to access the Topic, and then used
/// the QoS from the Topic to configure the fictitious built-in entities.
/// A consequence of this model is that the transient or persistence serviced can be configured by means of setting the proper QoS
/// on the Topic.
/// For a given Topic, the usual request/offered semantics apply to the matching between any DataWriter in the system that writes
/// the Topic and the built-in transient/persistent DataReader for that Topic; similarly for the built-in transient/persistent
/// DataWriter for a Topic and any DataReader for the Topic. As a consequence, a DataWriter that has an incompatible QoS with
/// respect to what the Topic specified will not send its data to the transient/persistent service, and a DataReader that has an
/// incompatible QoS with respect to the specified in the Topic will not get data from it.
/// Incompatibilities between local DataReader/DataWriter entities and the corresponding fictitious “built-in transient/persistent
/// entities” cause the REQUESTED_INCOMPATIBLE_QOS/OFFERED_INCOMPATIBLE_QOS status to change and the
/// corresponding Listener invocations and/or signaling of Condition and WaitSet objects as they would with non-fictitious
/// entities.
/// The setting of the service_cleanup_delay controls when the TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT service is able to remove all
/// information regarding a data-instances. Information on a data-instances is maintained until the following conditions are met:
/// 1. the instance has been explicitly disposed (instance_state = NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED), and
/// 2. while in the NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED state the system detects that there are no more “live” DataWriter entities
/// writing the instance, that is, all existing writers either unregister the instance (call unregister) or lose their liveliness,
/// and
/// 3. a time interval longer that service_cleanup_delay has elapsed since the moment the service detected that the previous

/// The utility of the service_cleanup_delay is apparent in the situation where an application disposes an instance and it crashes
/// before it has a chance to complete additional tasks related to the disposition. Upon re-start the application may ask for initial
/// data to regain its state and the delay introduced by the service_cleanup_delay will allow the restarted application to receive

/// This QoS policy controls the extent to which changes to data-instances can be made dependent on each other and also the kind

/// The setting of ordered_access controls whether the Service will preserve the order of changes.
/// The granularity is controlled by the setting of the access_scope.

/// • If access_scope is set to INSTANCE, the use of begin_coherent_change and end_coherent_change has no effect on
/// how the subscriber can access the data because with the scope limited to each instance, changes to separate instances
/// are considered independent and thus cannot be grouped by a coherent change.
/// • If access_scope is set to TOPIC, then coherent changes (indicated by their enclosure within calls to
/// begin_coherent_change and end_coherent_change) will be made available as such to each remote DataReader
/// independently. That is, changes made to instances within each individual DataWriter will be available as coherent with
/// respect to other changes to instances in that same DataWriter, but will not be grouped with changes made to instances
/// belonging to a different DataWriter.
/// • If access_scope is set to GROUP, then coherent changes made to instances through a DataWriter attached to a common
/// Publisher are made available as a unit to remote subscribers.
/// If ordered_access is set, then the access_scope controls the maximum extent for which order will be preserved by the Service.
/// • If access_scope is set to INSTANCE (the lowest level), then changes to each instance are considered unordered relative
/// to changes to any other instance. That means that changes (creations, deletions, modifications) made to two instances
/// are not necessarily seen in the order they occur. This is the case even if it is the same application thread making the
/// changes using the same DataWriter.
/// • If access_scope is set to TOPIC, changes (creations, deletions, modifications) made by a single DataWriter are made
/// available to subscribers in the same order they occur. Changes made to instances through different DataWriter entities
/// are not necessarily seen in the order they occur. This is the case, even if the changes are made by a single application
/// thread using DataWriter objects attached to the same Publisher.
/// • Finally, if access_scope is set to GROUP, changes made to instances via DataWriter entities attached to the same
/// Publisher object are made available to subscribers on the same order they occur.
/// Note that this QoS policy controls the scope at which related changes are made available to the subscriber. This means the

/// can be explicit by calling the assert_liveliness operations, or implicit by writing some data.

/// imposed by other QoS policies such as HISTORY and RESOURCE_LIMITS.
/// The DataReader also maintains information regarding the identity, view_state and instance_state of data-instances even after
/// all samples have been ‘taken.’ This is needed to properly compute the states when future samples arrive.
/// Under normal circumstances the DataReader can only reclaim all resources for instances for which there are no writers and for
/// which all samples have been ‘taken.’ The last sample the DataReader will have taken for that instance will have an
/// instance_state of either NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS or NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED depending on whether the last writer
/// that had ownership of the instance disposed it or not. Refer to Figure 2.11for a statechart describing the transitions possible for
/// the instance_state. In the absence of the READER_DATA_LIFECYCLE QoS this behavior could cause problems if the
/// application “forgets” to ‘take’ those samples. The ‘untaken’ samples will prevent the DataReader from reclaiming the
/// resources and they would remain in the DataReader indefinitely.
/// The autopurge_nowriter_samples_delay defines the maximum duration for which the DataReader will maintain information
/// regarding an instance once its instance_state becomes NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS. After this time elapses, the DataReader
/// will purge all internal information regarding the instance, any untaken samples will also be lost.
